# Simple Task Tracker

This app was created as an exercise.

Here are the instructions:

## Project Description
Develop a simple task tracker application that allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks. The application should have a command-line interface (CLI) for interaction.
 
## Requirements
 
### Task Management Functions
- Ability to add a new task with a title and description.
- Display a list of all tasks with their titles and descriptions.
- Update a task's title and/or description.
- Delete a task by its title.
 
### Data Storage
- Use an appropriate data structure (e.g., array, list) to store tasks.
- Implement functions/methods to manipulate the task data structure based on user inputs.
  
### Optional Features (Bonus)
- Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
- Implement error handling for invalid user inputs.
- Implement sorting or filtering options for task lists.

## Assumptions
- I am assuming that a Python script is an acceptable solution. This is compatible with having a command-line interface, and I would expect most people who choose to use a CLI already have Python installed.
- I am assuming that this will be a single-user, offline, small-scale app with a small amount of data. Thus, no database app or library is required and storing everything in files is OK.
